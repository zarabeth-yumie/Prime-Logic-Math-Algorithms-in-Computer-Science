# Prime Logic: Math Algorithms in Computer Science

**Author:** Mertkan Karaaslan (Zarabeth)

## Overview

This book serves as a comprehensive guide to number theory, explaining its fundamental principles and how they integrate with computer science. It bridges the gap between mathematical theory and its algorithmic applications in computing, focusing particularly on topics such as prime numbers, modular arithmetic, Diophantine equations, Euler's Totient Function, and continued fractions. With each concept, the book provides detailed C++ code examples and problem-solving tasks to solidify understanding. This resource is tailored for students, programmers, and anyone eager to learn how number theory underpins algorithms in modern computing.

## Key Topics

- **Divisibility, Primes, Co-Prime, GCD/LCM**
- **Continued Fractions**
- **Diophantine Equations**
- **Functions: Counting Divisors/Divisor Sum**
